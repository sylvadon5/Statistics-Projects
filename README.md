# Statistics Projects

There are four (4) projects to be completed using:

- Microsoft (MS) Excel
- Davis data set (DavisL Self-Reports of Height and Weight). 
  - Click this [`link`](https://rdrr.io/cran/carData/man/Davis.html) for more information about the data set. 
  - This [`link`](https://github.com/sylvadon5/data-files/blob/main/Davis.xlsx) takes you to the data set in MS Excel format.  

## About Davis Data Set
### Description

The Davis data frame (Self-Reports of Height and Weight) has 200 rows and 5 columns. The subjects were men and women engaged in regular exercise. There are some missing data. After removing all missing data, the data frame now has 181 rows and 5 columns. 

This data frame contains the following columns:
- `sex A` factor with levels: F, female; M, male.
- `weight` Measured weight in kg.
- `height` Measured height in cm.
- `repwt` Reported weight in kg.
- `repht` Reported height in cm.
