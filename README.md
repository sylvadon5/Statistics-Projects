# Statistics Projects

In this course, you will be completing four (4) projects using `Microsoft Excel` and the `Davis Data Set`. 

## About Davis Data Set
### Description

The Davis data frame (Self-Reports of Height and Weight) has 200 rows and 5 columns. The subjects were men and women engaged in regular exercise. There are some missing data. After removing all missing data, the data frame now has 181 rows and 5 columns. 

This data frame contains the following columns:
- `sex A` factor with levels: F, female; M, male.
- `weight` Measured weight in kg.
- `height` Measured height in cm.
- `repwt` Reported weight in kg.
